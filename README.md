This package allows to replace GUI popup menus (created by `x-popup-menu` by
default) with little temporary windows (like those in which Dired shows you
files you want to copy). In these windows menu items are displayed and
labeled with one or two letters. You press a key corresponding to desired
choice (or C-g) and you are done.

## Installation

Download this package and place it somewhere, so Emacs can see it. Then put
`(require 'ace-popup-menu)` into your configuration file. Done!

## Usage

Coming soon… (As soon as I'm done with it)

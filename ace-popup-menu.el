;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows to replace GUI popup menus (created by `x-popup-menu'
;; by default) with little temporary windows (like those in which Dired
;; shows you files you want to copy). In these windows menu items are
;; displayed and labeled with one or two letters. You press a key
;; corresponding to desired choice (or C-g) and you are done.

;;; Code: rere

  "Toggle ace-popup-menu-mode minor mode.
With a prefix argument ARG, enable ace-popup-menu mode if ARG is
positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp, enable
the mode if ARG is omitted or nil, and toggle it if ARG is
`toggle'.

This minor mode is global. When it's active any call to
`x-popup-menu' will result in call of `ace-popup-menu'
instead. This function in turn implements more efficient
interface to select an option from a list. Emacs Lisp code can
also use `ace-popup-menu' directly, in this case it will work OK
even if the mode is disabled."

;;; Commentary:

;; This package allows to replace GUI popup menus (created by `x-popup-menu'
;; by default) with little temporary windows (like those in which Dired
;; shows you files you want to copy). In these windows menu items are
;; displayed and labeled with one or two letters. You press a key
;; corresponding to desired choice (or C-g) and you are done.

;;; Code:

(require 'avy)

;; write something here, so it works

(provide 'ace-popup-menu)

;;; ace-popup-menu.el ends here
